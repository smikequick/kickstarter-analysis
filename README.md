# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project
This analysis includes a variety of unique perspectives around what makes an effective kickstarter campaign within the field of fine arts. There are many unique aspects about what makes an effective kickstarter, such as time of year, funding amount, and even the type of campaign within fine arts.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to make an informed decision about planning and executing an effective Kickstarter campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
A deeper analysis of successful launch date data for campaigns in the United States illustrated that the summer months (i.e. June, July) tend to be more successful than winter month campaigns (i.e. October, Novermber, and December). The difference between successful campaigns versus failed campaigns in the summer months is significant compared to the winter months, where there is almost an even result of successful and failed campaigns. See the graph below.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Additionally, further analysis was done regarding the Kickstarter campaign goals. Which campaigns were successful and why? Surprisingly, the campaigns that were most successful had an average goal of around $5,000. The top 25% of campaigns made $5,000 while the bottom 25% made $1,500. Campaigns that failed had twice the average goal (~$10,500) and has a larger quartile range than the successful campaigns (~$8,000). 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Some of the challenges that emerged through analysis were the outliers as indicated by the box and whisker plot below. Each point indicates an outlier campaign that is shifting the data. Ultimately, by using quartile data (e.g. top 75% or bottom 25%) we are able to get a sense of the range with which campaigns are successful and those of which that are not.

## Results
Based on a thorough review of the data, the best plan of action would be to run a campaign that is specifically focused on plays. These tend to yield a high success rate when timed correctly. The best time to launch a campaign like this would be in the summer months, beginning no later than June and running through July. This will result in the highest rate of successfully hitting the kickstarter goal.
